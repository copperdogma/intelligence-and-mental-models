# Research Questions and Tasks

## Priority 1: Establish Novelty

### Initial Focus
1. [ ] Choose specific discipline for initial literature review
   - Evaluate candidate disciplines:
     - Cognitive Science (predictive processing, mental models)
       - **Note**: Good starting point due to multidisciplinary nature
     - AI/ML (universal intelligence measures)
     - Philosophy of Mind (intelligence theories)
     - Systems Theory (efficiency across scales)
     - Decision Theory (prediction and efficiency in decision-making)
   - Select ONE discipline based on:
     - Relevance to core theory
     - Accessibility of literature
     - Potential for establishing novelty
     - Connection to efficiency and prediction
   - Defer other disciplines for later investigation

### Foundational Questions
1. [ ] Address core theoretical questions (from Nicole):
   - Prediction vs. Problem Solving
     - How is prediction different than problem solving?
     - Is prediction a subset or superset of problem solving?
     - How do they relate in intelligence measurement?

   - Scope and Inclusivity
     - Are we explaining one type of intelligence or all types?
     - What makes our model particularistic or exclusivist?
     - How does it relate to other intelligence measurements?
