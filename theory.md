# Theory of Intelligence as Efficient Prediction

## Introduction
This theory proposes a meta-definition of intelligence that encompasses all common definitions under one umbrella. By focusing solely on outcomes and efficiency, while remaining untied to specific models of cognition, it provides a universal framework for understanding intelligence in any form.

## Primary Section

### Core Definition
Intelligence is a measure of efficient prediction in a system within a given context.

This theory is unconcerned with how predictions are made, focusing solely on outcomes and efficiency. Context is inherent in all predictions, making the theory universally applicable across systems, from slime molds and ants to AI, humans, political bodies, and entire civilizations. By remaining untied to specific models of cognition, the theory provides a universal framework for understanding intelligence in any form.

### Core Principles

1. **Predictive Power as the Essence of Intelligence**
   - Intelligence is defined by the ability to anticipate outcomes effectively across domains, whether logical, social, emotional, or physical.

2. **Efficiency as an Essential Measure**
   - Intelligent systems maximize accuracy while minimizing resource use, balancing effort and precision based on the situation's complexity and stakes.
   - Intelligence isn't simply about being correct—it's about achieving correctness efficiently and proportionally.

3. **Meta-Intelligence**
   - Intelligence includes the ability to predict which models, heuristics, or approaches will yield the best results for the least effort.
   - Misallocating cognitive effort reflects a failure of meta-prediction.

4. **Scalability and Universality**
   - The theory applies at every level of complexity, from simple organisms to complex systems.
   - This universality allows intelligence to be evaluated independent of the underlying mechanisms.

5. **Adaptability in Uncertainty**
   - Intelligence thrives in navigating and adapting to uncertain or chaotic environments.
   - Systems demonstrate intelligence through revising mental models and forming new strategies.

6. **Outcome-Based Evaluation**
   - Intelligence is measured purely by the predictive outcomes achieved within a given context.
   - Broader applicability or understanding is unnecessary for intelligence in task-specific contexts.

### Implications

1. **Unified Framework**
   - Predictive capacity unifies diverse forms of intelligence by framing them as context-specific prediction systems.
   - Intelligence is agnostic to the mechanism, focusing purely on the ability to predict effectively and efficiently.

2. **Dynamic and Adaptive Intelligence**
   - Intelligent systems must balance predictive accuracy and resource use.
   - Adaptability, rather than static accuracy, is the hallmark of intelligence in uncertain environments.

3. **Applications Across Systems**
   - The theory applies universally to biological, artificial, and social systems.
   - Context is inherent to prediction, meaning intelligence is always evaluated within scope.

### Supporting Arguments

1. **Creativity and Innovation**
   - Creativity expands the range of possible outcomes by generating new mental models or scenarios to test
   - Innovation refines predictions by challenging assumptions and exploring novel solutions

2. **Emotional and Social Intelligence**
   - Emotional intelligence involves predicting how others will feel or respond in specific situations
   - Emotional regulation indirectly supports prediction by enabling clearer processing of social contexts

3. **Instincts and Reflexes**
   - Even instinctual behaviors in simple organisms are forms of prediction
   - Demonstrates that predictive intelligence exists on a spectrum

4. **Intuitive Insights**
   - Intuition is subconscious pattern recognition—predictions based on learned experience
   - Predictions don't need to be explicitly logical to be intelligent

5. **Meta-Predictions and Self-Regulation**
   - Predicting which mental model or strategy will provide the best outcome is itself intelligence
   - Effective intelligence includes managing cognitive resources and refining strategies through feedback

### Additional Implications

1. **Efficiency as a Core Metric**
   - Intelligence produces predictions that are accurate enough for the situation
   - Low-stakes tasks may use heuristics and approximations
   - High-stakes tasks require detailed and refined predictions

2. **Learning Through Feedback**
   - Intelligence grows by refining predictions over time
   - Systems adjust both direct predictions and meta-predictive strategies based on outcomes

## Development Section

### Mental Models Framework

1. **Definition and Purpose**
   - Mental models are internal simulations of reality, built from experience, observation, and imagination.
   - They serve as tools for making predictions by representing how the world works in various contexts.

2. **Relationship to Intelligence**
   - While not part of the core definition, mental models naturally align as a mechanism for prediction.
   - Refining mental models allows systems to make more nuanced, context-aware predictions.

### Resource Limitations and Intelligence

1. **Prediction vs. Resources**
   - Intelligence reflects predictive capacity within constraints.
   - Resource advantages don't indicate greater intelligence.

2. **Leverage of Resources**
   - Superior intelligence is demonstrated through effective use of available resources.
   - Success through efficient prediction despite resource limitations indicates higher intelligence.

## Assumptions & Constraints

1. **Core Assumptions**
   - Prediction is fundamental to all forms of intelligence
   - Efficiency is measurable relative to task complexity
   - Context is inherent in all predictions

2. **Theoretical Scope**
   - Applies to any system capable of prediction
   - Independent of specific mechanisms or implementations
   - Focused on outcomes rather than processes
