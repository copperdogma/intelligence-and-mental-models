# Project Evolution

## Milestone 20250119: Mathematical Formulation and Theory Expansion

### Major Developments
1. Added mathematical formulation of intelligence (I = P/R)
   - Defined intelligence as ratio of Predictive Power to Resource Consumption
   - Identified key insights from mathematical relationship
   - Established framework for quantitative analysis

2. Expanded Development Section
   - Added Resource Types and Classification
   - Explored Intelligence in Systems (static vs. dynamic)
   - Analyzed AI Implications
   - Added Model Evaluation framework

3. Structural Improvements
   - Separated Mental Models theory into distinct project
   - Created dedicated Mathematical Framework research track
   - Added new research priorities for Mental Models theory development

### Key Insights
1. Zero-resource intelligence concept (genetic/evolutionary intelligence)
2. Static vs. dynamic systems distinction
3. LLM intelligence evaluation framework
4. Model evaluation through intelligence metrics (Geocentric vs. Copernican example)

### Research Priorities
1. Mathematical framework development
2. Mental Models theory separation
3. Intelligence measurement standardization

### Next Steps
1. Define and measure Predictive Power (P)
2. Quantify Resource Consumption (R)
3. Develop standardized measurement approaches
4. Investigate edge cases 


## Milestone 20250119: Initial Framework Organization

### Major Developments
1. Established core theoretical framework in `theory.md`
   - Defined intelligence as efficient prediction
   - Outlined core principles and implications
   - Added supporting arguments and assumptions

2. Organized evidence and examples in `evidence.md`
   - Documented case studies across multiple domains
   - Identified counter-examples and their implications
   - Structured testable predictions

3. Structured research approach in `research.md`
   - Prioritized novelty, utility, and academic impact
   - Analyzed theory's novel contributions
   - Mapped connections to existing frameworks
   - Documented expert feedback and development opportunities

4. Created prioritized task list in `todo.md`
   - Organized tasks by strategic priorities
   - Detailed literature review requirements
   - Outlined empirical validation needs
   - Planned academic development path

### Key Decisions
1. Prioritized goals in order:
   - Establish novelty
   - Demonstrate utility
   - Pursue academic impact

2. Structured documentation into distinct areas:
   - Core theory and principles
   - Evidence and examples
   - Research and connections
   - Task planning

### Next Steps
1. Begin literature review to establish novelty
2. Develop practical metrics for utility demonstration
3. Refine theoretical framework based on findings
