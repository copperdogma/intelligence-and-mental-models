# Project Evolution

## Milestone 1: Initial Framework Organization (2025-01-09)

### Major Developments
1. Established core theoretical framework in `theory.md`
   - Defined intelligence as efficient prediction
   - Outlined core principles and implications
   - Added supporting arguments and assumptions

2. Organized evidence and examples in `evidence.md`
   - Documented case studies across multiple domains
   - Identified counter-examples and their implications
   - Structured testable predictions

3. Structured research approach in `research.md`
   - Prioritized novelty, utility, and academic impact
   - Analyzed theory's novel contributions
   - Mapped connections to existing frameworks
   - Documented expert feedback and development opportunities

4. Created prioritized task list in `todo.md`
   - Organized tasks by strategic priorities
   - Detailed literature review requirements
   - Outlined empirical validation needs
   - Planned academic development path

### Key Decisions
1. Prioritized goals in order:
   - Establish novelty
   - Demonstrate utility
   - Pursue academic impact

2. Structured documentation into distinct areas:
   - Core theory and principles
   - Evidence and examples
   - Research and connections
   - Task planning

### Next Steps
1. Begin literature review to establish novelty
2. Develop practical metrics for utility demonstration
3. Refine theoretical framework based on findings
