# Evidence Collection

## Examples
*Real-world applications and case studies supporting the theory*

### Biological Systems
1. **Slime Molds**
   - Demonstrate basic predictive intelligence through nutrient-seeking behavior
   - Efficiently allocate resources based on environmental cues

2. **Ant Colonies**
   - Exhibit collective intelligence through resource allocation
   - Outperform humans in certain collective decision-making tasks
   - Reference: Ants best humans at test of collective intelligence [science.org]

### Skill-Based Intelligence
1. **Combat Sports**
   - Success depends on efficient prediction of opponent's actions
   - Demonstrates how superior predictive ability can overcome resource disadvantages
   - Training refines subconscious predictive models for automated responses
   - Resource limitations (size, strength) affect outcomes but not intelligence measure
   - Example: Smaller fighter defeating larger opponent through superior predictive ability

2. **French Scrabble Champion**
   - Used exceptional memory and creative strategy to optimize predictions
   - Demonstrated superior intelligence within specific context
   - Example of effective resource leverage for prediction

### Governance Systems
1. **Capitalism vs. Communism**
   - Capitalism:
     - Distributed intelligence through millions of independent participants
     - Dynamic feedback loop of price signals and competition
     - Efficient resource allocation through decentralized prediction
     - Better suited for complex, dynamic systems
   - Communism:
     - Centralized prediction through authority
     - Lacks market feedback mechanisms
     - Theoretical potential if central authority had superior predictive ability
     - Practical limitations in managing complexity

2. **Government Operations**
   - Predictive efficiency in balancing:
     - Tax rates and regulations
     - Public goods vs. liberty costs
     - Short-term vs. long-term needs
   - Dynamic policy adaptation based on:
     - Changing circumstances
     - Citizen feedback
     - Resource constraints
   - Success measured by collective benefit optimization

### Artificial Systems
1. **The Chinese Room**
   - Task-specific intelligence through symbol manipulation
   - Demonstrates intelligence without understanding
   - Efficient prediction within defined context
   - Shows intelligence is about outcomes, not processes
   - Limited but sufficient for domain-specific intelligence

2. **Machine Intelligence**
   - Creates models surpassing human comprehension
   - Evaluated by predictive outcomes, not internal processes
   - Demonstrates theory's applicability beyond human understanding
   - Points to future extra-human predictive capabilities

### Meta-Intelligence Examples
1. **Wisdom vs. Intelligence**
   - Wisdom as meta-level extension of intelligence
   - Characterized by:
     - Broad repertoire of mental models
     - Flexible model application
     - Experience-driven generalization
   - Enables guiding others through model sharing
   - Demonstrates intelligence across time and context

2. **Human Cognitive Limits**
   - Humans dominate through broad predictive capacity
   - Limited by finite brain resources
   - Use simplified models to understand own intelligence
   - Shows intelligence-resource relationship

## Counter-Examples
*Cases that challenge or require refinement of the theory*

### Resource vs. Intelligence Distinction
1. **Combat Sports Outcomes**
   - Larger fighters may win despite inferior predictive ability
   - Highlights importance of distinguishing between resource advantages and intelligence
   - Shows why outcome alone doesn't measure intelligence

2. **Species Limitations**
   - Species with efficient but narrow intelligence
   - Demonstrates how resource constraints affect prediction scope
   - Shows intelligence measurement must consider context

### Emotional Intelligence
1. **Temper Control**
   - Resource limitations:
     - Genetic predispositions
     - Trauma effects
     - Shows need to separate constraints from intelligence
   - Predictive failure:
     - Poor value assessment of emotional control
     - Inadequate model refinement
     - Demonstrates intelligence through prediction management

## Predictions
*Testable implications derived from the theory*

1. **Systems Comparison**
   - Systems with better predictive efficiency should outperform those with mere resource advantages
   - Intelligence should be measurable through prediction accuracy relative to resource usage
   - Complex systems should show emergent predictive capabilities

2. **Adaptive Behavior**
   - More intelligent systems should show better adaptation to changing conditions
   - Meta-predictive ability should correlate with overall performance
   - Learning rate should reflect intelligence level

3. **Resource Independence**
   - Intelligence measures should remain consistent when controlling for resource differences
   - Systems should demonstrate predictive efficiency regardless of absolute resource levels
   - Context-specific intelligence should be measurable across different scales
